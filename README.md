# sqlDB
Using sql I built my database


how to build it:

download the repostory
```
cd sqlDB
```
```
mysql -u mysql_user -p < build.sql
```
run a script

you should now be able to run queries by using mysql
that I wrote in SQL instead of a tool like Microsoft Access
this is how it should look like after running showall.sql in the folder called query:
